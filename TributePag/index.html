                    <strong>Here's a time line of Hedy Lamarr life:</strong>

                    <li><strong>1913</strong> - Hedwing Eva Maria Kiesler was born on November 9, 1913, in Vienna, Austria.</li>
                    <li><strong>1931</strong> - Begins his film career</li>
                    <li><strong>1932</strong> - At the age of 19, she was engaged in a marriage of convenience with Fritz Mandl, an arms manufacturer. Fritz was a despotic philonazi who had supplied arms and ammunition to Mussolini's troops during the occupation of Abyssinia. Hedy had to abandon her budding film career. Despite this, Hedy took advantage of the endless meetings in which she escorted Fritz and his clients to learn about weapons technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>1933</strong> - She became famous for being the first woman to make a nude film. It was in the film "Ecstasy", in which for 10 minutes she appears completely naked, first immersed in a lake and then running through the Czech countryside.</li>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Hedy met, at a Hollywood party, the avant-garde composer George Antheil, with whom she immediately became friends.They designed a device inspired by the perforated rolls of pianolas and the cacophonies of some of George's musical experiments. In the final design, the two perforated rolls were incorporated into the transmitting and receiving stations, which could then synchronize and switch their frequencies. In this way, any intruder would detect a strange noise.</li>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong> - On August 11, 1942, the date on which the U.S.A. definitively entered the World War II, the patent was registered in Washington, D.C., and shortly thereafter, assigned to the U.S. Army. In the images that document it, the inscription H.K. Markey can be read. The initials are those of Hedwig Kiesler, Markey being her married name at the time.</li>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong> - The first public mention of the invention appeared in the New York Times, in spite of which, and although no one doubted the interest and relevance of the invention, the authorities of the time did not consider the possibility of its practical realization due to technological impediments.</li>
                    <li><strong>1957</strong> - 15 years after Hedy and George's patent was filed, the American firm Sylvania Electronics developed a remote control device in which the primitive perforated coils were replaced by electronic circuits. </li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong> - In the summer of 1999, the Vienna Kunsthalle organized a multi-media project, including a retrospective of her film career, as a tribute to one of the most unique actresses and inventors the century has known. Reportedly, when Hedy was told of the EFF award, she remained unperturbed and said tersely: "it's about me".            </li>
                    <li><strong>2000</strong> - On January 19, 2000 Hedy Lamarr died. </li>

            <p>The analysis gave me great freedom of emotions and terrific self-confidence. I felt I had served my sentence as a puppet.            </p>
